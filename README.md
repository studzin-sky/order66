This is my own react app created with Swapi.tech Api. 

The main purpose of this app is a Star Wars Lore search engine, where the user can search for data fetched from the API. 

This app is a search bar, fetching the query from SWAPI.tech - supporting the search parameter which filters throught the 
data and showcases the tiles of posibilities to click on. 
Clicking the element shows more details on the star wars lore object, and the name of the object is shown on history component.

 - Styled Components;
