<b>~27th May 2021~</b> <br>
I want to create my first react app, using REST API 'SWAPI'.
<br>
<br>
For this project, which will be my first solo project I want to create a library, <br>
where user can search for planets, starships or characters from STAR WARS saga. <br>
The goal is to show the user, the object which will be his choice, where he can learn <br>
what his query contains. <br>
<br>
For this app I want to use: <br>
- Objects <br>
- DOM manipulation<br>
- communication with API <br>
<b> But the most important thing will be my first ever use of React. </b>
