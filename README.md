<b>ATM branch I'm working on is called feature. In the meantime working on redux implementation on another branch called redux </b>
<br>
This is my own react app created with Swapi.tech Api.
<br>
The main purpose of this app is a Star Wars Lore search engine, where the user can search for data fetched from the API.
<br>
This app is a search bar, fetching the query from SWAPI.dev - supporting the search parameter which filters throught the data and showcases the tiles of posibilities to click on. Clicking the element shows more details on the star wars lore object, and the name of the object is shown on history component. History list is also clickable, which will show lore again.
<br>
The first API was swapi.tech, because swapi.dev was down on the time, when I was learning Fetch API to connect it. Now swapi.dev is back again, so this project finally is running on SWAPI.dev.

Technologies used:
<br>
	&bull;Styled Components<br>
	&bull;React JS<br>
	&bull;JavaScript<br>
	&bull;Fetch API<br>
